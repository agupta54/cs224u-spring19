# Course Overview 

## Goals of NLU

* Gain insights into human cognition
* Develop artificial agents as assistants or companions
* Solve a major subproblem of AI

## What is understanding?

To understand is to:

* determine its truth
* calculate its entailments
* take appropriate action in light of it
* translate into another language

## NLU: Traditional organization 

* Lexical semantics: meanings of words 
* Compositional semantics: meaning of sentences 
* Language in context: meanings of dialogues and discourses 

A different way of looking at NLU is trying to classify tasks based on output representations we are trying to produce. 

|Task|Output|
|----|------|
|sentiment analysis| scalars 
|vector space models| vectors/topic distributions|
|relation extraction | relation instances/database triples|
|semantic pasring| logical forms/other rich structures|
